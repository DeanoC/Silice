depends=("${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-python3"
         "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libftdi"
         "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gcc-libs")
makedepends=("git"
             "gawk"
             "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gcc"
             "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-make"
             "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-pkg-config"
             )

works out of the box
