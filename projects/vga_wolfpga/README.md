# WolfFPGA

*The wolfenstein 3D render loop*

## How to build

This projet requires a [VGA DAC](../DIYVGA.md). It was developped/tested for a 
MojoV3 board, and can be simulated with Icarus/Verilator

## Textures

The four textures in wolf.tga are damaged versions of the original ones 
(for copyright reasons), simply replace by those from your copy of the game 
for best results!
